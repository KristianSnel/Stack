## STACK media album manager

STACK is a mass online storage provider with unique functionality such as sharing individual folders with a url.
I've been using this system to regularely share media albums (photos, videos and others) with friends after having been on a holiday or event or such.
After a few years I've collected quite the photo albums, and i've easily lost track how many videos, photos an album has and who is on them.
This project strives to solve this problem and allows the creation of an album overview with additional information while also linking to the original STACK storage folder.

Data gathered per album
- title
- description
- date
- location
- tags (who have been in the photos/videos comma seperated, maybe even tags such as sport, activity, or event)
- content (json format with information regarding the content)
- url (stack storage folder url)

ToDo
- Add album
- Improve search functionality (maybe a search bar that suggests tag results)
- Security and login
- Details panel
